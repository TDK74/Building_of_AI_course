# Building of AI course

Course for Building of AI
If you are interested in AI, you'd better subscribe to the course. It is free of charge and it is fun. :)

Also, you'll know the instructions/conditions of the exercises in this way.

Note 1:

The examples are my solutions of the exercises. They are not the same as the solutions provided by the platform after the code evaluation.

Note 2:

The code is working on the course platform/site. Most of time it might/will not work directly copied to your local machines.
